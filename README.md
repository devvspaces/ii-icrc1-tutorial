# Accepting ICRC-1 Payment and Using Internet Identity

This project is a tutorial to guide you through building a simple application on the Internet Computer that uses Internet Identity for authentication and accepts ICRC-1 tokens for payment.

This is a blogging dapp that allows users to create posts and pay ICRC-1 tokens to be able to make more posts.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start building on the Internet Computer, you need to install the DFX command-line tool. You can find instructions on how to do this in the [SDK documentation](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html).

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- [Motoko](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html) for the backend canister
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

### Commands

Set the ICRC-1 token canister id

```bash
dfx canister call ii-icrc1-tutorial-backend set_icrc1_token_canister  "(\"mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai\")"
```

Send ICRC-1 tokens to a principal

```bash
dfx canister call icrc1_ledger_canister icrc1_transfer "(record { to = record { owner = principal \"akhd4-zekp3-xgj6k-yi2xm-kmhql-po33q-acj24-feepq-i7wik-kgigj-tae\";};  amount = 10000000000;})"
```
